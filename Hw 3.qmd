What percentage of the Wake County population resides in food deserts?

Evaluate the demographic makeup of the food desertsâ€”are residents of food deserts more likely to be poor or not own cars than the residents of Wake County as a whole (again, make sure you only include Wake County residents)? Calculate the percentage of households that do not own a vehicle, and the percentage of households who are low income, in both the food desert and Wake County overall.

```{r}

wake |>
  group_by(food_des) |>
  summarize(triangle_census_zero_vehicle_households=sum(triangle_census_zero_vehicle_households)) |>

sum(wake$triangle_census_total_households) 
# value = 400172

#1 is not in a food desert, 0 is in a food desert
#Food desert households without a vehicle 
(11267 / 400172) * 100
# Value = 2.815539

#Not food desert households without a vehicle 
(4611 / 400172) * 100
# Value = 1.152255

```
